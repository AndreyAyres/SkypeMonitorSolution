# SkypeMonitor

This is a set of projects for windows 10, written in CSharp to monitor your Skype status and update a Raspberry Pi connected to 
some multi-colored LEDs to give a "phsyical" representation of your current status.   

I used this solution when I work from home to keep my family updated on my status and when I am unavailable to talk to because I am
in a meeting.
